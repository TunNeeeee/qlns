# **Online Human Resource Management System**
## Description
**The Online Human Resource Management System** is a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. This system allows businesses to efficiently manage human resources, including features such as employee information management, attendance tracking, contract management, and leave form submissions.
