# **Online Human Resource Management System**
## Description
**The Online Human Resource Management System** is a full-stack web application developed using Spring Boot for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. This system allows businesses to efficiently manage human resources, including features such as employee information management, attendance tracking, contract management, and leave form submissions.

- **Why was this built?** The system is built to help companies manage employees and attendance online, eliminating the need for manual methods.
- **Problems solved:** The system addresses issues related to managing employee information, attendance tracking, payroll calculation, and contract management automatically and effectively.
- **What did I learn?** Through this project, I gained knowledge on integrating technologies such as Spring Boot, managing human resource processes, and optimizing the user experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
